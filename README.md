# 2DGame


# Overview
Overgrown is a 2D top-down game created in Unity. It is a two-player Co-op game in which the players fight radioactive enemies that do a significant amount of damage when they get too close to either player. The players share a health bar, so be careful. If one of you guys is taking a lot of damage, you will most likely fail to make it to the next wave. 

# Features
- Players can switch between using a sword or a hammer depending how they would like to attack the enemies that come after them. 
- The first wave of enemies will be very simple and should serve as a way to introduce players to the base mechanics of the game, but once you beat the original wave, good luck because it will definitely get more challenging. 
- Both players work simultaneously on a level by using the keys on a keyboard. One player uses wasd and the other uses ijkl.
- If players don't like sound, they can mute the game.
- Custom Animations of sprites(Developed by Erin)
- Enemies are drawn to a player and automatically follow the player based on position.
- Homepage to direct players to the actual combat or other preferences like options to see controls.
